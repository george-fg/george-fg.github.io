          <h4>Phase 0 Week 8 - Connecting</h4>
          <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
          <p>
            I haven’t had a chance to use them yet, but I wanted to note some of the ideas I’ve learned.
            <br>
            1.  Giving people the benefit of the doubt: assuming that they are just trying to do what seems right to them in that particular moment.
            <br>
            2.  If you assume that you are trustworthy, and act in that way, people are more likely to trust you.
            <br>
            3.  The three assumptions – assume everybody is here to serve the greater good; that they have no hidden agendas; and their opinions are reasonable to them, even though we might disagree. All of these are to be taken as true, unless proven otherwise.
          </p>
          <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
          <p>
            I tried this with my girlfriend. I listened and looped back her feelings on how she has been feeling today. She has been having a hard time with her anxiety recently. It was a good chat, and we discussed ways I could improve. She started crying as we talked, and we hugged afterwards. I want to use this in the future.
          </p>
          <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
          <p>
            It was difficult to visualize my person, along with saying the lines at the same time. I tend feel less angry at them, however.
            <br>
            I didn’t do the formalized Metta Bhavana meditation, however, I am planning to do that sometime in the future as part of my normal meditation practice.
          </p>
          <h5>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>
          <p>
            The situation I will be describing is an unfortunate incident that happened in Auckland when I began working as a bike courier. I had a disagreement over finishing a payment for a handheld device that I had bought off the outgoing bike courier (I was taking his place).
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>My view:</strong> The device didn’t work properly, it would disconnect several times per day. The former courier had stated it worked perfectly, and I had believed him. He had also been nice to me and helped me into my new role. I felt like I had been tricked when I began to have constant problems with it – it was half price, and we agreed I would pay half straight away, and half later on. When it began having problems I refused to pay the rest, which made him extremely angry. I didn’t want to have to pay the rest for a faulty device + a new one after that.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>His view:</strong> I had made an agreement with George that he would pay the rest for my former handheld once he had some money under his belt. I was infuriated when he refused to pay the second half of it, claiming that the device wasn’t working properly (even though it worked fine when I had it). I had rent to pay, and this shortfall actually affected me, unlike him and his financial position. George promised me something, and I had been nice and helped him into my former role. He had then let me down.
          </p>
          <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          <p>
            The idea of “mirror” neurons, and how we tend to be more empathetic to those similar to us (i.e. from the same ethnic group, or political party) was fascinating to me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, if I ever get into a management role and have to lay somebody off, I will definitely remember to use empathy rather than blunt force, like the author suggests.
            <br>
            <br>
            The other thing, which I have heard before, is praising to encourage a “growth” mindset rather than a “fixed” mindset. This is done by praising the process, i.e. “great effort on that task Chloe, you have put a lot of time into this and it’s paying off!” vs. “you are so smart Chloe, well done!” The first bit of praise makes you feel like you can do anything if you put your mind to it. The second reaffirms that you can only accomplish things if you already have particular traits, and when the going gets tough, you are more likely to give up.
