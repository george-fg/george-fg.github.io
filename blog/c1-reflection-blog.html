  I just finished watching Shereef’s talk – it was a great introduction for the DBC/EDA experience. I really liked what I heard, and I think watching his video has made me even more pleased that I am going to be a part of this community.
  <br>
  <br>
  The restaurant vs. kitchen analogy is a good one, as I hadn’t really thought about it like that. To be honest, part of me was very much in the restaurant camp prior to watching his talk: I had all these expectations about what I, in a way, “deserved” by coming here and paying my 11k to EDA. I think part of my belief in this respect was to do with the fact that I had spent almost 6 months of my hard earned savings to come here.
  <br>
  <br>
  I realize more clearly now that I am not entitled to this education nor a job at the end of it – no one is going to be spoon feed. The hard work has to come from me and my cohort, working hard together and supporting each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an introvert I often struggle with the emotional intensity of socializing, as I can often get drained quite quickly from too much interaction with people I don’t (or can’t) fully trust. I think this is going to be one of my major challenges, along with doubting my own ability, and comparing myself to others. The latter being something I have already been guilty of this week! Haha.
  <br>
  <br>
  My overall expectations have not really changed a whole lot – I just realize much more clearly now that if I want to succeed here, I really need to put the effort in.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am in charge of my own success.
