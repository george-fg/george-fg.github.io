        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        <p><a href="http://imgur.com/NKO01zw"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NKO01zw.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" alt="grid based design" /></a>
        <br><strong>Grid based design</strong> is a way in which web developers can more easily plan and create a webpageâ€™s layout. Typically they create a grid that covers the entire page, made up of rows and columns. 12 columns per row is used, as 12 is the lowest number that can be divided by 2, 3 and 4. Once they have created this intersecting grid, they can put html content such as images or paragraphs into these intersecting grid squares.</p>

        <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        <p>Having <strong>responsive webpage design</strong> is important as we have multiple different screen sizes, such as tablets and smartphones. A good developer understands this and will make sure her webpage accommodates these different screen sizes. For example, when the page is being viewed below 300px, the layout will change. (This would be useful for smartphones!)</p>

        <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
         <p><strong>Semantic structure</strong> refers to the <em>semantic tags</em>, and the order they are placed in. For example, we want the header tag at the top, followed usually by the nav, then they body, and so on. Good use of semantic structure allows both browsers and other programmers to more easily arrange and understand your code.</p>
