          <h4>Phase 0 Week 4 - Daily Mindfulness</h4>
          <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
          <p>
            I did the exercise with my partner, Chloe. It was nice. We discussed our struggles with study (She is at Weltec). I can see how this exercise would benefit a pair of people, as it requires conscious effort to stay with the other person’s conversation, but you really connect with them. We did looping as well. I will do this again in the future with her and probably others.
          </p>
          <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
          <p>
            I already have a regular practice, which I do daily in the morning, usually after a run. It’s pretty much a habit at this point. I am only doing twenty minutes right now, but I want to do more. I am not going to increase it for a while though. I want to solidify the habit completely first.
          </p>
          <h5>Other musings.</h5>
          <p>
            In my meditation I am now “noting” a thought or feeling, calling it either “thinking” or “feeling”, followed by one of three states - “pleasant”, “unpleasant”, or “neutral”. I am also trying to notice when I get distracted throughout the day, followed by the same noting technique.
