        <h4>Phase 0 Week 2 - Developing Emotional Intelligence</h4>
        <h5>Meditation and the book - <em>Search Inside Yourself.</em></h5>
        <p>
          The book <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> by Chade-Meng Tan is awesome. In this post, I am just going to reflect on the introductory video and Chapter 1 of the text, both which I have viewed.
          <br>
          <br>
          As I mentioned earlier in one of my other posts, I have been practicing mindfulness meditation on and off for almost 6 months now. I believe I am starting to see some of the benefits, such as increased empathy and a better awareness of my own changing emotional state(s). As such, reading about the scientific evidence behind meditation in <em>Search Inside Yourself,</em> is really reassuring that I am onto something.
          <br>
          <br>
          It was also insightful to be able to understand exactly why mindfulness meditation helps with emotional IQ development, i.e. through training your ability to hold attention. I hadn’t fully made this connection until now. By training <em>attention,</em> one is able to have more awareness of when one is distracted, and thus is able to recover the mind more quickly, bringing the attention back to the task at hand.
          <br>
          <br>
          By not being so easily caught in the daily flood of emotions and thoughts, we are able to more easily recognize the emotions of ourselves and the people around us. This is why mindfulness builds Emotional Intelligence.
          <br>
          <br>
          The other beautiful thing Meng mentioned was that he and other expert meditators believed that our “default” state is happiness. That, if we can get really good at meditation through calming the waters of the mind, we can come to a place of joy all by ourselves.
          <br>
          <br>
          He talks also in the book about Mathieu Ricard, a French Buddhist monk who was dubbed by the global media as the “happiest man in the world”. He earned this title after undergoing brain scans at the University of Wisconsin, where scans showed that when Ricard meditated on compassion, his brain produced a level of gamma waves – those linked to consciousness, attention, learning and memory – that had ‘never been reported before in neuroscience literature’. The scans also showed excessive activity in his brain’s left prefrontal cortex compared to its right counterpart, giving him an abnormally large capacity for happiness and a reduced propensity towards negativity. <strong>This is the power of meditation! It’s neuroplasticity at work.</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          In terms of my own practice, I am up to 20mins a day. I use Headspace, as it’s easy and simple. I am hoping to go on a retreat at some point as well.
