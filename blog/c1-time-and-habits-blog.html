        <h4>Phase 0 Week 1 - Time and Habits</h4>
        <h5>Which time box and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
        <p>
          I have tried the Pomodoro technique a few times before, but never enough to fully get into the habit of doing it regularly. I think I will aim to use that technique or something similar to it in the coming weeks ahead, as I am finding at the moment my study time is pretty unstructured!
        </p>
        <h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
        <p>
          I found <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">this page</a> particularly interesting for me personally, as I have been practicing meditation for about 6 months now, on and off. The science behind it was really useful to know, as prior to reading the article I had only a vague idea of the psychology behind meditation.
          <br>
          I have been trying to get more consistent with my practice. I use a website called Headspace which you can get on your phone or your computer. It’s an AWESOME app for meditation – it makes the whole process really simple and approachable.
        </p>
        <h5>What worked for you?</h5>
        <p>
          As I mentioned above, I have been practicing mindfulness meditation for the last 6 months or so. I took a course in Buddhist meditation initially, but later switched to using Headspace after I completed the course. It’s something that I feel has been making a difference in my life, especially around my work as being a Parking Officer.
          <br>
          <br>
          I really want for it to become a regular ‘thing’ – currently I don’t practice every day, just when I remember to do so. It really needs to be done daily though. Perhaps I could use the Fogg method, and get that habit sorted?!
        </p>
        <h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
        <p>
          The Pomodoro technique, and the Fogg method both look promising. I will be definitely investigating those over the next week or so.
