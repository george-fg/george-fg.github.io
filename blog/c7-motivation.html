          <h4>Phase 0 Week 7 - Motivation</h4>
          <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
          <p>
            ‘Pleasure’ refers to the type of happiness where you are always looking for the next high. It reminds me of going to expensive restaurants, buying a new car or PC, or spending money on a holiday.
            <br>
            ‘Passion’ or ‘flow’ is where you are doing a task or project where it is neither too easy, nor too difficult. That way, it is a great challenge and you derive satisfaction from completing it. In the right setting, it is more sustainable than seeking pleasure.
            <br>
            And finally, ‘purpose’ – this is where you are part of something bigger than yourself, and that thing has meaning to you. This is often through altruism.
            <br>
            Purpose is the most sustainable form of happiness of the three as it is almost impossible to habituate to it. Pleasure, in contrast, habituates quickly, forcing you to continually seek the next high. Flow is more sustainable than pleasure, but it too can trickle off or not even get going in the first place. The author of SIY suggests we should focus on finding a job or vocation that aims to align ourselves with a higher purpose, and one that brings us meaning. If we can do this, we can gain a highly sustainable form of happiness.
          </p>
          <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values? And what do you stand for?</h5>
          <p>
            I want to be a kind, emotionally intelligent, and compassionate person; one who is attuned to the feelings and needs of others. I want to be there for people when they need me.
            <br>
            I want to stand up for women, minorities, and those with mental illnesses.
            <br>
            I want to be a good man, a man who can be trusted and relied upon.
            <br>
            I want to be a peaceful man, who never uses or believes that violence is ever ok.
            <br>
            I want to be a loving father in the future, one who was more caring than my own.
            <br>
            I want to do something about stopping climate change, and to help somehow with assisting in the creation of safe AI.
            <br>
            I want to change capitalism somehow, to allow it to work for the environment, not against it.
            <br>
            I want to retire earlier than most, and to live a minimalistic lifestyle, with a focus on meditation and self-reflection.
            <br>
            I want to reject consumerism.
          <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
          </p>

            It was interesting. I focused on my officer’s selection board test week for the negative portion. I had tried to become an officer in the NZ army around 2 years ago. I didn’t make it past the last stage to be selected for training, and failing the selection has left me with a sense of shame and anxiety around the memories of it. I always wanted to join the army, and in the test week I had one of the best fitness scores out of the 100 or so people attending. In the exercise I noticed a semi-intense level of anxiety rising around the top of my tummy, which I just watched and noted. I didn’t feel any shame per se, but what I did notice was that the intensity of the memory was not so bad when I just noted it without judgement.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the positive portion I couldn’t think of anything massively significant, so I focused on the time I captured the ‘Time Lost Proto Drake’ in World of Warcraft. For those who are not aware, the drake is a dragon which you try to find and kill. When it is killed, it drops a mount called Reins of the Time Lost Proto Drake, which you can ride and fly around on. It only spawns once every month or so, hence the difficulty of finding and killing it. It’s extremely rare and much sought after. It was also very much a head-turner when you visited some of the major cities at the time. I spent around 3 months hunting it. When I finally found it late one evening, I was overwhelmed with adrenaline and pure joy. I was literally shaking and screaming with happiness when I mounted the drake. It was an incredible feeling at the time. In the exercise, I noticed adrenaline, in my tummy, but it was a positive version compared to the previous exercise. I also noticed myself smiling and feeling happy.
          </p>
          <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          <p>
            The idea that it takes 3 positive experiences to overcome 1 negative experience really hits home for me. It makes complete sense in terms of evolution as well. You’re much more likely to survive if you focus on what you did wrong, so you don’t do it again or so you can avoid doing it in the first place.
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s useful to recognize this internal negativity bias. We can recognize this bias more easily with using mindfulness
