          <h4>Phase 0 Week 6 - Control</h4>
          <p>
            <h5>What learnings did I take from SIY's chapter 5?</h5>
            We learned about the author’s method to deal with triggers, which he calls the Siberian North Railroad Technique. This stands for “Stop”, “Note”, “Reflect”, and “Respond”. This method can be used in difficult situations, such as when you’re about to become suddenly angry, etc. By taking time to breathe, and noticing your emotions in your body, you’re able to give yourself more time to reflect and then to respond. Reflection allows for cognitive reframing to happen as well.
            I also learned that the better I get at noticing without judgement, the better my logical and emotional minds can work together. I can see before I act.

            <h5>How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
            I practiced the above technique as a trial run; I can see how it could be useful in hot situations. I recently purchased an expensive computer, which I feel may have been quite impulsive. I felt anger in me and shame after the purchase. I concentrated on that, and used it for the exercise. I’ve noticed I really want to justify the purchase by coming up with some half-good reasons, along with seeking affirmation from other people. I think I’ve been using that reasoning as a way to defuse the anger and shame that have come up. It even feels difficult to write this paragraph. So that’s been interesting to notice.
