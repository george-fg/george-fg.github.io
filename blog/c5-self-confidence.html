          <h4>Phase 0 Week 5 - Self Confidence</h4>
          <br>
          <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
          <p>
            Mindfulness and self-awareness are very similar, if not exactly the same. Mindfulness can be trained, and thus self-awareness can be trained. Both are extremely useful in developing emotional intelligence, and working towards mastery of one’s changing emotional states.
          </p>
          <h5>My experience with body scanning.</h5>
          <p>
            The body scanning exercise mentioned in the book is exactly what I do with my normal meditation practice on Headspace. Early in the meditation exercise, I will scan from head to toe, covering each part of my body in-depth. If I notice a sensation, I stay mindful of it. If I notice a lack of sensation, I stay mindful of it also. I try to be a thorough as I can, and will bring back the mind if distracted. It definitely helps me relax, and I’ve been practicing it in bed to recently to help me sleep.
          </p>
          <h5>What I took away from <em>Search Inside Yourself's</em> "My Emotions Are Not Me" section.</h5>
          <p>
            Reading this section of the book made me feel happy. It reminded me of what I have heard before – that once you develop strong mindfulness, you come to the realization that you are NOT your emotions. You do not have to be engulfed by them. You can separate your “self” from the full force of an emotion or thought, and instead watch it from a distance. With enough practice, you may eventually be able to just notice emotions as sensations that arise purely from the body. This becomes a road to mastery of your changing emotional states.
