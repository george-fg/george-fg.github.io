        <h3>How the DOM, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together
        </h3>

        <p>
            A good way of explaining this is through an analogy of the human body.
            <br>
            <br>
            First and foremost we have <strong>HTML</strong>, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is a bit like the human skeleton, it is the basic framework on which a webpage is built. It always comes first.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coming up next is <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which essentially programs the behavior of a webpage and allows us to do all the cool stuff, like displaying a clock with an updating time. In that way, it is similar to a brain and the organs of a human body.
            <br>
            <br>
            And to complete our trio, we have <strong>CSS</strong>, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is like human skin, and the clothing we wear. It is the superficial layer of a webpage, where we aim to make stuff look good through visual styling.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bringing this all together, we get the <strong>Document Object Model</strong>, or <strong>DOM</strong> for short. The DOM is created when a web browser pulls together the information from the trio above, and displays that information on a webpage. In this way, the DOM is like a person, complete and complex.

        <h3>Boxifying Design and the Box Model</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Boxifying design</strong> is a way in which a web developer can think about elements on his or her webpage. All elements in HTML are essentially boxes - understanding this can make development a lot easier because square or rectangular boxes are simpler to adjust and plan for.
            <strong>The box model</strong> is the entirety of an element. The model includes properties such as padding, margins, and actual content.
