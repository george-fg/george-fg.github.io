          <h4>Phase 0 Week 3 - The Meditation Process.</h4>
          <br>
          <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself?</h5>
          <p>
            I already have had a fair bit of experience with meditation, so what was mentioned in chapter 2 and the video was familiar to me.
          </p>
          <h5>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h5>
          <p>
            The idea of <em>Meta attention</em>, which is the ability to realize you have been distracted in the first place. It differs from holding attention. The way Meng explained this was really insightful.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also the notions of self and what is self, was really fascinating.
          </p>
          <h5>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
          <p>
            I had heard about the lotus pose before, and meng reaffirmed its importance by explaining why it is so well regarded – i.e., its useful as its one of the best poses for remaining both relaxed and alert at the same time. Unfortunately, it’s quite a difficult pose to get into as a westerner, as we are used to sitting in chairs, not on the floor. It’s something I want to utilize in the future though.
          </p>
          <h5>Other musings on Meditation, and how did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
          <p>
            I am up to 15 days in a row of solid meditation. All this reading of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> has really motivated me!
          </p>
          <p>
            In regard to my Website:
            <br>
            To be completely honest, I went out the window a little bit with regard to the amount of time spent on rebuilding. I spent almost 11 hours on it, nearing double the amount of time I was meant to take. A lot of this was actually wrapping my head around skeleton, and troubleshooting though. But I was starting to get a little perfectionistic towards the end, and there are still things that bug me about it. I need to try to stop comparing my site to others websites!
