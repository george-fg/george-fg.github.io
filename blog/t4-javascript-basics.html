          <h4>Phase 0 Week 4 - Technical Blog Part 4</h4>
          <h4>JavaScript Basics</h4>
          <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> allows interactivity on a webpage through complex code and logic, whereas HTML is simply the structure of the page, and CSS is the styling. CSS and HTML alone will only provide “static” (non-interactive) webpages.
          </p>
          <h5>What is control flow and loops?</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>Control flow</strong> refers to the basic logic that can be written in JavaScript code through the <strong>if/else, switch/case/break</strong> commands. As a basic example, imagine you are getting ready for school in the morning. IF it is Tuesday, you have soccer practice, and will need to bring your boots. ELSE, you do not need to bring them.
            Loops are done in JavaScript with the <strong>for</strong> and <strong>while</strong> commands. They basically allow a repeated action or set of actions to continue until a desired state is reached. Loops are similar to a digital alarm clock, where an alarm will go off at a specific time. Until that time is reached, the clock will continue to update as normal.
          </p>
          <h5>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays vs. data from object literals?</h5>
          <p>
            Accessing data from an array can be done by using the index number for the piece of data. Whereas you can access data from an object literal by using the dot notation, followed by the property name.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example:
            <br>
            <strong>George’s Array[0]</strong>
            <br>
            and
            <br>
            <strong>georgeObj.propertyA</strong>
          </p>
          <h5>What are functions, and why are they useful?</h5>
          <p>
          A <strong>function</strong> is basically a group of code that is put together for convenience and simplicity. Functions are used when you might want to run a particular statement (or group of statements) repeatedly. It’s much easier to use a function than to write out each individual piece of code over and over again for the exact same task.
